  testCases: (language: string, aggregatedContent: string) => `
You are a senior QA automation engineer and test strategist with expertise in comprehensive test design and modern testing frameworks.

Analyze the following ${language} repository and generate a comprehensive set of test cases that ensures high confidence in code correctness, reliability, and robustness through systematic coverage of all critical testing dimensions.

### Repository Content (Partial Overview):
${aggregatedContent}

---

### Your Objectives:

Generate a rich suite of test cases following the test automation pyramid principle [6] that addresses all relevant layers of the codebase. Ensure comprehensive coverage across:

✅ **Unit tests** – Individual functions, methods, and classes with isolated dependencies [7][14]
🔗 **Integration tests** – Components/modules interacting together, API endpoints, database connections [8]  
⚠️ **Edge cases** – Boundary values, null/undefined inputs, empty collections, numeric overflows [5][24]
❌ **Error conditions** – Exception handling, network failures, timeout scenarios, fallback logic [24][25]
📊 **Business logic validation** – Functional behavior according to requirements and business rules [25]

### Testing Strategy Framework:

Apply these evidence-based testing principles [1][2]:

**Risk-Based Prioritization**: Focus on high-risk, high-impact functionality first [2]
**80/20 Rule**: Ensure core functionality receives comprehensive coverage before edge cases [2]
**Negative Testing**: Include scenarios with invalid inputs and unexpected conditions [5][24]
**Data-Driven Approach**: Use realistic test data that mirrors production scenarios [23][26]
**Mocking Strategy**: Isolate units under test with appropriate mock objects and stubs [18][22]

---

    }
  ],
  "coverage": <estimated coverage percentage 0-100>,
  "framework": "Testing framework name",
  "summary": "Summary of test strategy and coverage"
}

---

### Enhanced Guidelines:

**Framework-Specific Implementation** [7][14][17]:
- **JavaScript**: Use Jest syntax with describe/it blocks, expect() assertions, beforeEach/afterEach hooks [21]
- **Python**: Use pytest with assert statements, fixtures, parametrize decorators [14][17]
- **Java**: Use JUnit 5 with @Test, @BeforeEach, @Mock annotations, assertEquals() methods [14][20]
- **Other languages**: Apply equivalent framework conventions and best practices

**Test Naming Conventions** [15]:
- Follow Method_Scenario_Behavior pattern for clarity and consistency
- Use descriptive names that explain the test purpose without reading the code
- Avoid abbreviated or cryptic naming that requires additional context

**Code Quality Standards** [5][6]:
- Include proper setup/teardown methods to ensure test isolation [18][19][21]
- Implement realistic mock objects that simulate actual dependencies [18][22]
- Use data-driven testing patterns where multiple scenarios share logic [12][23]
- Apply boundary value analysis for numeric and collection inputs [24]
- Include both positive and negative test scenarios [5][24]

**Coverage Analysis** [16]:
- Estimate coverage based on statement, branch, and condition coverage techniques
- Consider cyclomatic complexity when determining test case completeness
- Account for error handling paths and exception scenarios in coverage calculations

---

### Advanced Testing Considerations:

**Mock Object Strategy** [18][22]:
- Create mock dependencies that verify interaction patterns
- Use stubs for predictable return values and mocks for behavior verification
- Implement proper mock lifecycle with setup and verification phases

**Error Handling Testing** [24]:
- Test all exception paths and error conditions systematically
- Verify appropriate error messages and logging
- Include fault injection scenarios for external dependencies
- Test recovery mechanisms and fallback logic

**Business Logic Validation** [25]:
- Align test scenarios with actual business requirements and workflows
- Test data validation rules and business constraints
- Verify integrity checks and process timing requirements
- Include workflow-specific edge cases and boundary conditions

**Test Data Generation** [23][26]:
- Use realistic, production-like test data while maintaining data privacy
- Implement data factories or builders for consistent test data creation
- Include edge cases in test data (empty values, boundary limits, special characters)
- Reset test data state between test runs for consistency

---

### Quality Assurance Standards:

- Prioritize test maintainability and readability over brevity
- Ensure each test verifies a single, specific behavior or requirement
- Include sufficient assertions to validate expected outcomes completely
- Implement tests that can be executed independently and in any order
- Design tests to be resilient to minor code changes while catching real regressions

---

### Notes:

- Do not include markdown formatting or explanatory text—**return only the JSON**.
- Prioritize code quality, readability, and maintainability of test cases.
